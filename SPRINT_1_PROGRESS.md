# Sprint 1 Progress Report

## Session Summary (August 14, 2025)

### What We Built Today

1. **LandscapingDataAnalyzer Service** (`/src/lib/services/LandscapingDataAnalyzer.ts`)
   - Core service to extract and analyze QuickBooks data
   - Implements BusinessComplexityProfile from our blueprint
   - Methods to test our complexity detection assumptions
   - Extracts key metrics: cash, receivables, fixed assets, revenue patterns

2. **Sprint 1 Analysis API Endpoint** (`/src/app/api/sprint1/analyze-landscaping/route.ts`)
   - Test endpoint to run analysis against real QB data
   - Returns structured analysis results with assumption tests
   - Provides tab recommendations based on detected complexity

3. **QuickBooksClient Updates**
   - Made backward-compatible to support both client and server usage
   - Added constructor overload for direct token injection
   - Updated methods to accept optional companyId parameter

### Key Implementation Details

#### Business Type Classification
- Analyzes expense structure (labor vs materials ratio)
- Thresholds: >30% materials = product, >40% labor = service
- Default to service for landscaping business

#### Complexity Detection Algorithm
```typescript
// Our initial thresholds to test:
requiresARAnalysis: totalReceivables > 10000
requiresSeasonalAnalysis: revenueConsistency < 0.7
requiresEquipmentSchedule: fixedAssets > 25000
```

#### Data Quality Assessment
- Checks for P&L and Balance Sheet completeness
- Verifies presence of Income/Expenses sections
- Evaluates data period length (6+ months = good)

### Next Steps When We Resume

1. **Test the Analysis Endpoint**
   - Navigate to `/api/sprint1/analyze-landscaping`
   - Review actual QB data extraction results
   - Validate our assumptions against real numbers

2. **Refine Based on Results**
   - Adjust complexity thresholds if needed
   - Improve business type detection logic
   - Fix any data extraction issues discovered

3. **Complete Sprint 1 Goals**
   - Document what analysis actually matters for service businesses
   - Validate which tabs would be useful
   - Create Sprint 1 results report

### Current Status

- ✅ Foundation service created
- ✅ API endpoint ready for testing
- ⏸️ Waiting to test with real QB data
- ⏸️ Need to validate assumptions
- ⏸️ Need to document learnings

### Code Ready to Commit

All changes are ready to commit:
- Backward compatible QuickBooksClient updates
- New LandscapingDataAnalyzer service
- Sprint 1 test API endpoint

### Questions to Answer Next Session

1. Does our A/R threshold of $10K make sense for landscaping?
2. Is the equipment threshold of $25K appropriate?
3. Can we reliably detect service vs product businesses?
4. What's the actual data quality from QuickBooks?
5. Which analysis tabs would actually help this business?
