# Financial Forecasting Research & Implementation Guide

This document serves as our comprehensive reference for understanding financial forecasting principles and implementing sophisticated forecasting capabilities in our application.

## üìä Executive Summary

Financial forecasting is the practice of projecting a company's future financial performance based on key assumptions ("drivers") and historical data. The power lies in creating interactive models where adjusting any assumption instantly cascades through the entire forecast, showing immediate impact on cash flow, runway, and profitability.

**Key Insight**: Professional forecasting models separate **Inputs** (adjustable levers) ‚Üí **Calculations** (automated formulas) ‚Üí **Outputs** (actionable insights). This architecture enables real-time scenario analysis.

## üéØ Core Concepts

### Driver-Based Modeling
Financial models are built on **assumptions** that function as "levers" - inputs that users can adjust to see cascading effects throughout the forecast. As the Corporate Finance Institute notes: "financial modeling assumptions are the levers that control your model's behavior and results."

### The Three-Statement Integration
Professional models integrate:
- **Income Statement** (P&L): Revenue, expenses, profit
- **Balance Sheet**: Assets, liabilities, equity
- **Cash Flow Statement**: Operating, investing, financing cash flows

Changes to any assumption flow through all three statements, providing a complete financial picture.

### Scenario Planning
The core value proposition: "What if tariffs increase 50%?" or "What if we cut marketing by 20%?" Users adjust levers and immediately see the impact on runway and cash position.

## üèó Model Architecture

### 1. Inputs/Drivers Tab
The "control panel" where all key assumptions are entered:
- Growth rates and pricing assumptions
- Cost percentages and fixed expenses
- External factors (tariffs, inflation, etc.)
- Financing and capital plans

**Best Practice**: Color-code inputs and use data validation to prevent formula-breaking changes.

### 2. Calculations/Financial Statements
Multiple interconnected sheets performing calculations:
- **Revenue Build**: Sales by product/channel with detailed drivers
- **COGS Sheet**: Unit costs, tariffs, variable cost calculations
- **Operating Expenses**: Payroll, marketing, rent with scaling assumptions
- **Working Capital**: AR/AP/Inventory with timing assumptions
- **Integrated Statements**: P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow

### 3. Outputs/Summary
Digestible results for decision-making:
- Key metrics dashboard (runway, profitability, ratios)
- Scenario comparisons (Base vs. High Tariff vs. Optimistic)
- Charts and visualizations
- Sensitivity analysis tables

**Example Structure**: A 25-tab model might include cover sheet, assumptions, 3-5 calculation sheets, 3 financial statements, supporting schedules, scenario analysis, and output summaries.

## üéõ Key Forecast Levers

### Revenue Drivers
**Universal Variables:**
- Overall sales growth rate per period
- Pricing changes and seasonal fluctuations
- New product/service launches

**Business Model Specific:**
- **DTC/E-commerce**: Website traffic, conversion rate, average order value
- **SaaS**: New subscribers/month, ARPU, churn rate
- **Retail**: Foot traffic, conversion rate, average basket size
- **Services**: Billable hours, utilization rate, hourly rates

### Cost & Expense Drivers
**Variable Costs** (scale with revenue):
- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) as % of revenue
- Shipping, credit card fees, commissions
- Per-unit production costs

**Fixed Costs** (remain constant short-term):
- Rent, insurance, base salaries
- Software subscriptions, utilities

**Key Insight**: Distinguish fixed vs. variable costs. A 50% tariff might change COGS from 30% to 45% of sales, dramatically impacting gross margin.

### Working Capital Drivers
Critical for cash flow timing:
- **Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)**: How quickly customers pay
- **Inventory Days**: How much inventory to maintain
- **Days Payable Outstanding (DPO)**: Payment terms with suppliers

**Impact**: Even profitable businesses can run out of cash if working capital assumptions are wrong. Growing sales might consume cash for inventory before customer payments arrive.

### Macroeconomic & External Factors
Assumptions about broader environment:
- **Regulatory**: Tariffs, tax rate changes, new compliance costs
- **Economic**: Inflation, interest rates, recession scenarios
- **Competitive**: Market share changes, new competitors
- **Industry**: Overall market growth or decline

### Financing & Capital Assumptions
- New funding rounds (debt/equity) and timing
- Interest rates and repayment schedules
- Capital expenditures for growth
- Working capital credit lines
