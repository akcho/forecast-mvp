## ‚úÖ MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: Monthly Data Extraction (Aug 15, 2025)

### Problem Solved
**Issue**: QuickBooks API was returning only YTD totals instead of monthly breakdowns
**Root Cause**: Double-wrapping bug in `quickbooksServerAPI.ts` - we were incorrectly wrapping QB's native response structure

### Solution Implemented
1. **Fixed API Response Structure**
   - Removed incorrect `QueryResponse.Report` wrapper in `makeRequest()`
   - Updated `QuickBooksReport` interface to match actual QB API response
   - QB API already returns data in correct format - no additional wrapping needed

2. **Added Monthly Data Methods**
   ```typescript
   // Get 12+ months of historical data with monthly columns
   async getMonthlyProfitAndLoss(monthsBack: number = 24): Promise<QuickBooksReport>
   
   // Get current month actuals (month-to-date)
   async getCurrentMonthActuals(): Promise<QuickBooksReport>
   ```

3. **Confirmed Working Monthly Data**
   ```json
   {
     "monthsRetrieved": 14,
     "monthlyDataColumns": [
       "", "Aug 2024", "Sep 2024", "Oct 2024", "Nov 2024", "Dec 2024",
       "Jan 2025", "Feb 2025", "Mar 2025", "Apr 2025", "May 2025", 
       "Jun 2025", "Jul 2025", "Total"
     ],
     "summarizeColumnsBy": "Month"
   }
   ```

### Impact
- **‚úÖ Historical Data**: 12 months of monthly P&L breakdowns (Aug 2024 - Jul 2025)
- **‚úÖ Current Actuals**: Month-to-date performance tracking
- **‚úÖ Foundation Ready**: All data needed for three-statement financial modeling

## üîç Technical Insights

### QuickBooks API Behavior
- **Monthly Columns**: QB returns individual month columns when `summarize_column_by=Month` + sufficient historical data
- **Data Range**: Sandbox has 14 months of data (Aug 2024 - Aug 2025)  
- **Response Structure**: Direct JSON response, no additional wrapping needed
- **Current Month**: Separate API call for month-to-date actuals vs historical months

### Code Structure
- **API Layer**: `src/lib/quickbooks/quickbooksServerAPI.ts` - Fixed response handling
- **Test Integration**: `src/app/api/sprint1/analyze-landscaping/route.ts` - Added monthly data validation
- **Interface Updates**: Removed double-nested `QueryResponse.Report` structure

### Validation Results
```json
{
  "sprint2Tests": {
    "monthlyDataExtraction": {
      "status": "successful",
      "monthsRetrieved": 14,
      "currentMonthData": true,
