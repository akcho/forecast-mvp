# Sprint 2: Essential Tabs & Financial Integration
*Date: August 15, 2025*

## üéØ Goal
Build the 5 essential tabs identified in Sprint 1 with proper three-statement financial integration. Focus on simple service businesses first, with mathematical relationships that fractional CFOs trust.

## üìã Sprint 1 Foundation

### What We Validated ‚úÖ
- **Business complexity detection**: A/R >$10K and Equipment >$25K thresholds work well
- **Service business classification**: Expense pattern analysis is reliable (85% confidence)
- **Tab relevance**: Simple businesses need 5 tabs, not 25
- **Data extraction**: QuickBooksServerAPI successfully pulls real financial data

### Essential Tabs Identified
1. **P&L Statement** - Core financial performance
2. **Balance Sheet** - Financial position
3. **Cash Flow Statement** - Liquidity management
4. **Assumptions Hub** - Model parameters  
5. **Customer Analysis** - Always valuable for service businesses

## üéØ Sprint 2 Objectives

### Primary Goal
**Build mathematically integrated 5-tab financial model** that generates trustworthy forecasts for simple service businesses.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] P&L Statement with 12-month forecast based on real QB data
- [ ] Balance Sheet with working capital projections
- [ ] Cash Flow Statement with operating/investing/financing flows
- [ ] Assumptions Hub with controllable business parameters
- [ ] Customer Analysis with service business insights
- [ ] Mathematical integration: Changes flow correctly between statements
- [ ] Validation checks: Model balances and makes financial sense

## üìä Technical Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Core Financial Statements

#### P&L Statement Implementation
```typescript
interface ProfitLossModel {
  // Historical data (from QB)
  historicalRevenue: MonthlyData[];
  historicalExpenses: ExpenseCategories[];
  
  // Forecast assumptions
  revenueGrowthRate: number; // Monthly %
  expenseInflation: number;  // Annual %
  
  // Generated forecast
  forecastRevenue: MonthlyData[];  // 12 months
  forecastExpenses: ExpenseCategories[]; // 12 months
  forecastNetIncome: MonthlyData[]; // Revenue - Expenses
}
```

#### Balance Sheet Integration
```typescript
interface BalanceSheetModel {
  // Current position (from QB)
  currentCash: number;
  currentAR: number;
  currentAP: number;
  fixedAssets: number;
  
  // Working capital projections
  projectedAR: MonthlyData[]; // Based on sales & DSO
  projectedAP: MonthlyData[]; // Based on expenses & DPO
  projectedCash: MonthlyData[]; // From cash flow statement
}
```

#### Cash Flow Integration
```typescript
interface CashFlowModel {
  // Operating cash flow (from P&L + working capital changes)
  operatingCashFlow: MonthlyData[];
  
  // Investing cash flow (equipment purchases, etc.)
  investingCashFlow: MonthlyData[];
  
  // Financing cash flow (loans, owner draws)
  financingCashFlow: MonthlyData[];
  
  // Net cash flow = Operating + Investing + Financing
  netCashFlow: MonthlyData[];
}
```

### Week 2: Mathematical Integration & Validation

#### Three-Statement Integration Rules
1. **P&L ‚Üí Balance Sheet**: Net Income flows to Retained Earnings
2. **P&L ‚Üí Cash Flow**: Revenue/Expenses adjusted for A/R, A/P changes
3. **Balance Sheet ‚Üí Cash Flow**: Working capital changes affect operating cash flow
4. **Cash Flow ‚Üí Balance Sheet**: Net cash flow updates cash position

#### Validation Checks
- [ ] Balance Sheet balances (Assets = Liabilities + Equity)
- [ ] Cash reconciliation (Beginning + Net Cash Flow = Ending)
- [ ] Working capital makes sense (A/R based on sales, A/P on expenses)
- [ ] Growth assumptions are reasonable for service businesses

### Week 3: Service Business Specialization

#### Customer Analysis Tab
Based on service business characteristics:
- Revenue concentration by customer (if data available)
- Service delivery patterns (recurring vs project-based)
- Customer acquisition/retention insights
- Seasonal revenue patterns (if detected)

#### Assumptions Hub
Service business focused parameters:
- Revenue growth rate (monthly/annual)
- Customer acquisition rate
- Customer retention rate  
- Average project/service value
- Labor cost inflation
- Overhead growth rate

## üîß Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Data Foundation (Days 1-3) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
1. **Extend QuickBooksServerAPI** to extract monthly historical data ‚úÖ DONE
2. **Build financial data parser** to create structured monthly datasets ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS
3. **Implement basic validation** to ensure data completeness üìã NEXT

**BREAKTHROUGH (Aug 15)**: Fixed double-wrapping bug - now extracting 12+ months of real monthly data from QuickBooks API with `summarize_column_by=Month` parameter working correctly.

### Phase 2: P&L Forecast Engine (Days 4-6)
1. **Historical trend analysis** from QB data
2. **Growth assumption application** to generate 12-month forecast
3. **Expense categorization** and inflation adjustment
4. **Revenue forecasting** based on service business patterns

### Phase 3: Balance Sheet Projections (Days 7-9)
1. **Working capital modeling** (A/R, A/P based on business cycles)
2. **Asset projections** (equipment purchases, depreciation)
3. **Equity calculations** (retained earnings accumulation)

### Phase 4: Cash Flow Integration (Days 10-12)
1. **Operating cash flow** calculation from P&L + working capital
2. **Investing cash flow** modeling (equipment, expansion)
3. **Financing cash flow** (owner draws, loan payments)
4. **Cash reconciliation** and validation

### Phase 5: UI & Validation (Days 13-15)
1. **Assumptions Hub interface** for adjusting key parameters
2. **Validation dashboard** showing model health checks
3. **Customer Analysis insights** presentation
4. **End-to-end testing** with landscaping sandbox data

## üìä Data Requirements

### Enhanced QB Data Extraction
```typescript
interface EnhancedFinancialData {
  // Monthly historical data (not just YTD totals)
  monthlyPL: MonthlyProfitLoss[];
  monthlyBalanceSheet: MonthlyBalanceSheet[];
  
  // Additional detail for service business analysis
  customerSales?: CustomerSalesData[]; // If available
  expenseDetail: DetailedExpenseCategories;
  
  // Service business metrics
  averageProjectValue?: number;
  recurringRevenue?: number;
  laborVsOverheadRatio: number;
}
```

### Business Assumptions
```typescript
interface ServiceBusinessAssumptions {
  // Growth parameters
  monthlyRevenueGrowth: number; // %
  customerGrowthRate: number;   // %
  averageProjectGrowth: number; // %
  
  // Cost parameters  
  laborInflation: number;       // Annual %
  overheadInflation: number;    // Annual %
  equipmentReplacementRate: number; // Years
  
  // Cash flow parameters
  daysSalesOutstanding: number; // A/R collection
  daysPayableOutstanding: number; // A/P payment
  cashReserveTarget: number;    // Minimum cash
}
```
