# Sprint 1: Foundation & Reality Check

**Goal**: Test our assumptions about financial model complexity against real QuickBooks data from landscaping business. Focus on understanding what analysis actually matters for service businesses.

**Data Reality**: Several months of QB data (not 3 years), so we'll focus on current state analysis rather than historical trends.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Questions to Answer

### Business Complexity Detection
- Can we reliably identify this as a "service business" from QB data?
- What financial patterns distinguish service businesses from product businesses?
- Do our complexity categories (seasonality, customer concentration, etc.) make sense?

### Model Structure Relevance  
- Which of our planned analysis tabs would actually be useful for this business?
- Are our thresholds realistic (A/R >$10K, equipment >$25K, etc.)?
- What analysis would a fractional CFO actually want for this type of business?

### Data Quality & Availability
- What financial data is actually available in QuickBooks?
- How clean/messy is the data we'll be working with?
- What assumptions about data availability are wrong?

## ðŸ“Š Data Analysis Plan

### Week 1: Current State Deep Dive

#### **QB Data Extraction**
- [ ] Extract P&L data (all available months)
- [ ] Extract Balance Sheet (current position)
- [ ] Extract A/R Aging report
- [ ] Extract Customer Sales report (if available)
- [ ] Extract any equipment/fixed asset data
- [ ] Document what data is available vs missing

#### **Financial Metrics Calculation**
```typescript
// Calculate actual metrics for this business
interface CurrentStateMetrics {
  // Cash flow patterns
  currentCash: number;
  totalReceivables: number;
  dso: number; // Days sales outstanding
  
  // Customer analysis
  totalCustomers: number;
  top5CustomerRevenue: number; // % of total
  customerConcentration: 'high' | 'moderate' | 'low';
  
  // Business structure
  fixedAssets: number;
  monthlyRevenue: number; // Recent average
  grossMargin: number;
  
  // Cost structure
  laborCosts: number; // % of revenue
  equipmentCosts: number; // % of revenue
  variableVsFixedCosts: {
    variable: number;
    fixed: number;
  };
}
```

#### **Business Type Classification**
- [ ] Revenue patterns: Project-based vs recurring vs mixed?
- [ ] Cost structure: Labor-heavy vs equipment-heavy vs balanced?
- [ ] Customer mix: B2B vs B2C vs mixed?
- [ ] Service delivery: On-site vs remote vs hybrid?

### Week 2: Assumption Testing & Validation

#### **Tab Relevance Testing**

**A/R Aging Analysis**
- Current A/R balance: $X
- Age distribution: Current vs 30+ vs 60+ days
- Customer payment patterns
- **Question**: Would A/R aging tab be useful for managing this business?

**Customer Concentration Analysis**  
- Revenue by customer (top 5, top 10)
- Customer type distribution
- Payment term variations
- **Question**: Is customer concentration a real risk factor?

**Equipment/Asset Schedule**
- Fixed asset values
- Depreciation schedules
- Equipment maintenance costs
- **Question**: Does equipment analysis matter for this service business?

**Seasonal Analysis** (Limited by data)
- Month-to-month revenue variation (what we can see)
- Cost variation patterns
- **Question**: Even with limited data, do we see seasonal indicators?

#### **Threshold Calibration**

Test our assumptions against real numbers:
```
Our Assumption â†’ Real Data â†’ Conclusion

A/R >$10K needs analysis â†’ Actual A/R: $X â†’ Threshold makes sense / too low / too high
Top 5 customers >50% = high concentration â†’ Actual: X% â†’ Adjust threshold
Equipment >$25K needs schedule â†’ Actual assets: $X â†’ Relevant / irrelevant
```

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Data Extraction Service
```typescript
class LandscapingDataAnalyzer {
  async extractComprehensiveData(): Promise<LandscapingBusinessData> {
    // Pull all available QB data
    // Calculate financial metrics
    // Analyze business patterns
    // Document data quality issues
  }
  
  analyzeBusinessComplexity(data: LandscapingBusinessData): BusinessProfile {
    // Test our complexity detection algorithm
    // Return profile with confidence scores
  }
  
  validateTabRelevance(data: LandscapingBusinessData): TabRelevanceAnalysis {
    // For each planned tab, assess usefulness
    // Return recommendations: essential / useful / skip
  }
}
```

### Analysis Output
```typescript
interface Sprint1Results {
  // Data quality assessment
  dataAvailability: {
    pnlMonths: number;
    balanceSheetComplete: boolean;
    arAgingAvailable: boolean;
    customerDataQuality: 'good' | 'limited' | 'poor';
  };
  
  // Business characteristics
  businessProfile: {
    type: 'service' | 'product' | 'hybrid';
    complexity: 'simple' | 'moderate' | 'complex';
    confidence: number; // 0-100%
  };
  
  // Tab recommendations
  recommendedTabs: {
    essential: string[]; // Must have
    useful: string[];    // Nice to have
    skip: string[];      // Not relevant
  };
  
  // Assumption validation
  assumptionTests: {
    assumption: string;
    testResult: 'confirmed' | 'needs_adjustment' | 'wrong';
    recommendation: string;
  }[];
}
```

- [ ] Calculate meaningful financial metrics from real data
- [ ] Business complexity algorithm runs and produces results
- [ ] Identify data quality issues and limitations

### Learning Success
- [ ] Understand what makes this landscaping business financially complex
- [ ] Validate at least 5 of our model structure assumptions
- [ ] Identify at least 3 assumptions that need adjustment
- [ ] Document what data limitations mean for MVP scope

## ðŸš§ Expected Challenges & Mitigation

### Challenge: Limited Historical Data
**Impact**: Can't test seasonality, growth trends, or forecast accuracy
**Mitigation**: Focus on current state analysis and business structure understanding

### Challenge: Data Quality Issues
**Impact**: Calculations may be unreliable or incomplete
**Mitigation**: Document all data issues; build robust error handling

### Challenge: Single Business Sample
**Impact**: May not generalize to other service businesses
**Mitigation**: Document landscaping-specific findings vs general service business patterns

### Challenge: Assumption Confirmation Bias
**Impact**: May see patterns we expect rather than what's actually there
**Mitigation**: Actively look for contradictory evidence; document surprises

## ðŸ“Š Deliverables

### End of Week 1
- [ ] **Data Extraction Report**: What data is available, quality assessment
- [ ] **Business Profile**: Detailed analysis of landscaping business characteristics
- [ ] **Financial Metrics**: Current state calculations (DSO, margins, etc.)

### End of Week 2  
- [ ] **Assumption Validation Report**: Which assumptions proved correct/wrong
- [ ] **Tab Relevance Analysis**: Recommendations for model structure
- [ ] **MVP Scope Adjustment**: Updated blueprint based on learnings
- [ ] **Sprint 2 Planning**: Priorities based on Sprint 1 discoveries

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Decisions to Make

By end of Sprint 1, we need to decide:

1. **Model Complexity**: How many tabs does a typical service business actually need?
2. **Data Requirements**: What's the minimum viable data for professional quality?
3. **Business Classification**: Can we reliably detect service vs product businesses?
4. **Threshold Calibration**: Are our complexity thresholds realistic?
5. **MVP Scope**: Should we focus on service businesses only, or try to generalize?

## ðŸ”„ Learning Mindset

**Things We Expect to Learn**:
- Our thresholds are wrong (too high/low)
- Some planned analysis isn't useful for service businesses  
- Data quality is worse/better than expected
- Landscaping has unique patterns we didn't consider

**Things We Hope to Confirm**:
- Three-statement integration is achievable with QB data
- Dynamic model structure is better than fixed templates
- Service businesses do need specialized analysis
- Our general approach makes sense

**Mindset**: Be wrong quickly and learn fast. The goal is to emerge from Sprint 1 with a much better understanding of what we're actually building.
