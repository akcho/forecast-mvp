# Aging Reports Implementation - September 17, 2025

## Required Context

**📖 Read First**: [`../SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md`](../SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md)

Essential background on:

- Current financial forecasting system architecture
- Existing QuickBooks integration patterns to follow
- Service layer architecture and authentication patterns
- Working capital modeling services to integrate with

## Getting Started

**→ Execute**: [`step1-test-first-implementation/implementation-plan.md`](step1-test-first-implementation/implementation-plan.md)

This test-first approach discovers QuickBooks API capabilities before building elaborate services, minimizing rework risk.

**Timeline**: 5-8 hours total (test QB APIs → build core infrastructure → implement service layer)

## Why Test-First?

The biggest risk is assuming QuickBooks has robust aging report APIs. Testing first reveals:

- Whether `AgedReceivables`/`AgedPayables` endpoints exist
- Actual response formats vs assumptions
- If we need transaction-based fallback approaches
- Performance with real company data

## Integration Context

The aging reports implementation will:

- Follow existing `/api/quickbooks/profit-loss` authentication patterns
- Integrate with current `WorkingCapitalModeler` service
- Support the driver-based forecasting system (Sprint 3)
- Enhance cash flow forecasting with real aging data

## Next Steps After Step 1

Depending on what we discover about QB APIs, we may:

- Use proven approaches from the reference plans
- Adapt the implementation based on QB limitations
- Build enhanced features if native aging reports work well

The reference plans provide detailed guidance and follow-up but should be further informed by step1 results rather than executed blindly. Don't do anything past what's required for executing Step 1.
