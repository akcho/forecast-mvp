Persistent QuickBooks Online API Access for All Users (Admin & Non-Admin)

Understanding QuickBooks Online OAuth and User Roles

QuickBooks Online (QBO) uses an OAuth 2.0 flow for third-party API access. A company administrator (Master Admin or Company Admin in QBO) must perform the initial authorization for any app integration. Non-admin users cannot independently authorize a new API connection – if they try, QBO will block it with an error like “Only administrators can buy apps in the company…” ￼. In contrast, logging into the QuickBooks website itself allows any valid user to sign in (with access limited by their role). This difference is key: QBO’s API only allows admins to grant data access, whereas the QBO web UI allows all users to log in (with appropriate permissions).
• QBO Website Login: Any user with a QuickBooks Online account (admin or non-admin) can log into the QBO web dashboard using their credentials. Their access to features (like viewing the Profit & Loss report) depends on permissions set by the admin. For example, a non-admin user with “Reports only” access could view company reports on the QBO site.
• QBO API App Authorization: Only an admin-level user can connect a third-party application to the QBO company. The OAuth consent flow must be completed by an admin – non-admin users will be prevented from completing it ￼. This is a security measure by Intuit to ensure that only trusted individuals (admins) grant third-party apps access to company financial data.

One-Time Authorization by an Admin User

To achieve a “log in once and persistent access” behavior, design your app’s flow so that an admin user authorizes the QBO connection one time. After that, your app can reuse the established connection for all users. Here’s how to implement it: 1. Initiate OAuth Login via Intuit: Provide a “Connect to QuickBooks” button or similar in your app. When clicked, redirect the user to Intuit’s OAuth 2.0 authorization URL (with your app’s client ID, redirect URI, and scopes). This will bring up the familiar Intuit QuickBooks Online sign-in page ￼, so the experience matches the normal QuickBooks login flow. The user enters their QBO credentials and consents to your app’s requested permissions. (Make sure you request the necessary scope such as com.intuit.quickbooks.accounting for accessing financial data/reports.) 2. Admin User Grants Consent: Ensure that the person doing this is a QBO admin for that company, since only admins can authorize the connection ￼. Once they log in and approve, Intuit will link your app to the company’s data. 3. Receive Authorization Code and Exchange for Tokens: After consent, Intuit’s server redirects back to your app’s callback URL with an authorization code. Your app then exchanges this code for an access token (for API calls) and a refresh token (for getting new tokens later). This is the standard OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow. 4. Store Tokens Securely: Save the tokens (particularly the refresh token, and the “realm ID” which is the company ID) in a secure manner (e.g. in an encrypted database). This is critical – you will use these tokens for all future API requests. The OAuth tokens are not tied to an individual end-user’s login session in your app, but rather to the QBO company’s connection. Intuit’s OAuth is designed so that you connect once and store the credentials; after that, your app can call the API at any time without further user interaction ￼. In other words, after the one-time admin login, your integration has its own access to QuickBooks data. 5. Use the Access Token for API Calls: Now you can use the access token to call QBO API endpoints (e.g. the Profit and Loss report endpoint) on behalf of the company. The token grants your app the same data access that the admin user who authorized it would have in QuickBooks. You can fetch the P&L report via the QuickBooks API and display it in your app. The data returned will reflect the company’s financials just as seen on the official QBO dashboard (you can specify parameters like date range or cash/accrual basis to match the QBO report settings).

By following the above steps, the initial login/authorization happens only once. The key is that the app now has its own authenticated context for accessing the company’s data, so individual users won’t need to repeatedly log into QuickBooks or ask an admin to re-share anything.

Persisting the Connection with Refresh Tokens

OAuth access tokens are short-lived (valid for ~1 hour), but QuickBooks provides refresh tokens to maintain a persistent connection without further user logins ￼ ￼. Here’s how to ensure continued access to the data (so that even weeks or months later, users can still get the P&L report without another QuickBooks login):
• Refresh Token Usage: Along with the access token, Intuit returns a refresh token. The refresh token is long-lived (valid for 100 days by default) and can be used to obtain new access tokens when the old ones expire ￼. In your app’s logic, catch any “token expired” responses (HTTP 401 errors) and trigger a token refresh request in the background. This will yield a new access token and a new refresh token. Importantly, Intuit rotates the refresh token value periodically (typically every 24 hours upon use) as a security measure ￼. Always update your stored tokens to the latest values returned by the API.
• Token Refresh Flow: Refreshing is a server-to-server call: your app sends a POST request to Intuit’s OAuth endpoint with the refresh token and your client credentials, and gets back a new set of tokens. This does not require any user interaction. From the user’s perspective, access is seamless and “always on”. For example, if a non-admin user in your app requests the P&L report, your backend can ensure a valid token is available (refreshing it if necessary) and then call the QBO API to fetch the data – all behind the scenes.
• Avoiding Re-authorization: As long as you refresh the token at least once within any 100-day period, the connection remains alive indefinitely ￼. In practice, you might automate a refresh cycle (e.g. refresh tokens every day or week, or whenever making API calls after a long idle period) to ensure the token never goes stale. If the refresh token is allowed to expire (no refresh for over 100 days), then the admin would need to re-connect the app via the OAuth flow again ￼. Thus, managing the token lifecycle is crucial for a truly persistent login experience.

By properly storing and refreshing tokens, the QuickBooks auth will behave just like a persistent login – the initial sign-in grants continuous access. Your users (admin or not) won’t be prompted to log into QuickBooks repeatedly. Non-admins will no longer need to request an admin to “share” or re-authenticate the connection, because your integration maintains it for them.

Enabling All Users to Access the P&L Data

Once the admin has authorized the app and you’ve stored the tokens, all authorized users in your application can be given access to the QuickBooks data as needed. The API calls you make with the saved tokens are performed on behalf of the company’s QBO account, not any individual user. In fact, after the OAuth handshake, there is no specific QuickBooks user context attached to API calls – your app is authorized to access the data regardless of which user is currently using your app ￼. This means a non-admin user in your app can retrieve the Profit & Loss report via the API just as an admin can, as long as your app’s logic permits it.

Keep in mind a few best practices and considerations:
• Mirroring QuickBooks Permissions (Optional): In QuickBooks Online’s own UI, non-admin users might have read-only access or be restricted from seeing certain data (depending on roles). The API tokens, however, typically allow full read access to all data your app was authorized for. If you want to mimic QuickBooks’ permission structure, you’ll need to enforce that in your app. For example, if some users shouldn’t see financial reports, you’d implement that check in your application before showing the P&L. However, since you mentioned these non-admin users are expected to have access to reports like P&L, you probably can simply allow them to use the feature. Just be aware that from QuickBooks’ perspective the data is being accessed under the admin-authorized app’s credentials, so QBO isn’t restricting which data is returned – your app is in control of who sees it.
• User Login vs. Data Access: You might wonder if each user needs to “log in with QuickBooks” to use the app. They do not need to individually authorize the QuickBooks connection again. The single admin consent covers the whole company. For a smooth user experience, you can handle user authentication into your app via your normal login system (or even allow Intuit single sign-on, discussed below), and then simply use the stored QBO tokens to fetch data for the company that the user is part of. This way, using the P&L report in your app feels as straightforward as logging into QuickBooks and viewing the dashboard – with no extra approval steps.

Matching the QuickBooks Online Login Experience

To ensure the login flow is as familiar and seamless as QuickBooks Online’s own, you should leverage Intuit’s standard sign-in process and possibly their single sign-on features:
• Intuit OAuth Login UI: As noted, the OAuth 2.0 authorization will direct the user (admin) to Intuit’s hosted login page. This is the same interface they use to log into QBO, so it meets your requirement of matching the main QuickBooks website login. The user enters the same credentials they would on qbo.intuit.com, and if already logged in, Intuit may skip straight to the consent prompt. Using this OAuth flow means you don’t have to handle passwords or mimic the login UI yourself – Intuit provides the trusted login page for you ￼.
• Intuit Single Sign-On (OpenID Connect): If you want all users (not just the admin) to authenticate via Intuit (for example, to log into your application using their Intuit account), Intuit supports OpenID Connect as an identity layer. This allows your app to accept an Intuit login for user authentication, similar to “Sign in with Intuit”. Intuit’s developer guides suggest setting up OpenID Connect for a simplified user sign-in experience and an added layer of security ￼. With this approach, any user (admin or non-admin) can log into your app using their Intuit credentials, and you can retrieve basic profile info (name, email, etc.) to identify them ￼. This login is separate from the data access authorization – it’s purely for verifying identity in a familiar way. You can combine this with the single stored company token: e.g. a non-admin user logs in via Intuit SSO (so they feel like they “logged into QuickBooks” through your app), and your back-end then uses the pre-authorized token to fetch the P&L data. This setup makes the experience for all users almost identical to using QuickBooks Online directly, with the convenience of not having to ask an admin each time.

By following these practices, all users will have a smooth experience: the initial connection uses the official QuickBooks Online login and consent flow, and thereafter everyone can access the Profit & Loss report through your app as if they were logged into QuickBooks itself. The admin only has to approve the connection once, and your application maintains the authenticated link to QuickBooks Online. Non-admin users won't be repeatedly prompted for admin approval – they'll see the data they need, on-demand, just like on the official QBO dashboard, while your integration handles the authentication behind the scenes.

Data Flow for Non-Admin Users

Understanding how non-admin users access QuickBooks data without QuickBooks accounts:

1. User Authentication (Google OAuth): User signs in with Google, creating a user record in your application. No QuickBooks interaction required.

2. Company Association: Admin manually adds user's email to the company's team members, creating a user_company_roles record linking the user to the company.

3. API Request Flow: When the non-admin user requests financial data:
   - App checks user_company_roles to verify user has access to the company
   - App retrieves the company's QuickBooks connection (quickbooks_connections table)
   - App uses the COMPANY's access_token (not user-specific) to call QuickBooks API
   - QuickBooks validates only that the token is valid for that realm_id
   - Data is returned and displayed to the user

4. Key Technical Detail: QuickBooks API requires only:
   - Valid access_token (from the company's stored connection)
   - Correct realm_id (the QuickBooks company identifier)
   - No user context or user-specific authentication is needed or checked

Example API call that works for ANY user in the company:
```
GET https://sandbox-quickbooks.api.intuit.com/v3/company/{realm_id}/reports/ProfitAndLoss
Authorization: Bearer {company_access_token}
```

This is why one admin authorization enables access for all team members - the QuickBooks API operates at the company level, not the user level. The access token IS the authentication, representing the company's permission grant, not any individual user's credentials.

     |<--P&L Report---------------|                           |
```

The key insight: QuickBooks thinks it's the company/admin making the request, not the individual user. The non-admin user never directly interacts with QuickBooks.
