# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this AI-powered financial forecasting web application. The platform transforms QuickBooks data into actionable business intelligence through driver-based forecasting for small businesses and fractional CFOs.

## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: Keep This File Current

**MANDATORY**: Update this CLAUDE.md file EVERY time you make significant changes to the codebase. This ensures Claude Code has accurate context for future development work.

**When to Update:**
- New features or major functionality changes
- Architecture modifications or service updates
- API endpoint changes or additions
- Status updates (completed features, current roadmap)
- Tech stack or dependency changes

**What to Update:**
- Current Status section with latest feature completion
- API Endpoints if routes change
- Core Architecture if services are modified
- Remove deprecated information immediately

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev     # Development server (localhost:3000)
npm run lint    # ESLint checks
npm run test    # Custom test runner (src/lib/test/runTests.ts)
npm run build   # Production build
```

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14.1.0 (App Router), TypeScript (strict)
- **UI**: Tremor React, Tailwind CSS, Heroicons, Recharts
- **Database**: Supabase (auth, multi-company data)
- **APIs**: QuickBooks OAuth2, OpenAI, Google SSO

## Core Architecture

**Current System**: Driver-based forecasting with real-time QuickBooks data analysis

**Data Flow**: QuickBooks P&L â†’ Driver Discovery â†’ Forecast Engine â†’ Interactive Dashboard

**Key Services**:
- `DriverDiscoveryService` - Systematic QB data analysis with scoring algorithm
- `DriverForecastService` - Real-time projections with confidence scoring
- `FinancialDataParser` - Structured data extraction from QB reports
- `InsightEngine` - 3-insight psychology framework for business recommendations

**Key Directories**:
- `/src/app/` - Pages: `/forecast/` (main interface), `/analysis/` (AI chat)
- `/src/components/` - `ForecastDashboard.tsx`, `DriverDashboard.tsx`, `QuickBooksLogin.tsx`
- `/src/lib/services/` - Core business logic and data processing

## Driver-Based Forecasting System

**Core Algorithm**:
```
Score = (Materiality Ã— 0.3) + (Variability Ã— 0.2) + (Predictability Ã— 0.2) +
        (Growth Rate Ã— 0.2) + (Data Quality Ã— 0.1)

Include if: Score > 0.4 AND Materiality > 1% AND >= 6 months data
```

**Key Features**:
- Automatic driver discovery from real QuickBooks data (no hardcoded assumptions)
- Interactive forecast controls with real-time updates
- 3-scenario modeling (Baseline/Growth/Downturn)
- Confidence scoring based on data quality and predictability

## Multi-Company Authentication

**Architecture**: Company-owned QuickBooks connections with role-based access

**Database Schema**:
```sql
companies: id, quickbooks_realm_id, name, created_at
users: id, email, google_id, name, created_at
user_company_roles: user_id, company_id, role ('admin'|'viewer'), created_at
quickbooks_connections: company_id, access_token, refresh_token, ...
```

**User Flow**:
- Google SSO for user authentication
- Admin connects QuickBooks once per company
- All users access shared company connection
- Non-admin users don't need QuickBooks accounts

## API Endpoints

**Core Production APIs**:
- `GET /api/quickbooks/discover-drivers` - Driver discovery with materiality scoring
- `POST /api/quickbooks/generate-forecast` - Interactive forecasting with driver controls
- `GET /api/quickbooks/profit-loss?parsed=true` - Structured P&L data
- `GET /api/quickbooks/status` - Connection validation

**Authentication APIs**:
- `/api/quickbooks/callback` - OAuth callback with company creation
- `/api/auth/[...nextauth]` - Google SSO integration

## 3-Insight Psychology Framework

**Rationale**: Based on cognitive psychology research - users make better decisions with 3 focused insights vs overwhelming lists

**Structure**:
1. **Primary Concern** (Warning/Risk) - Most urgent issue requiring attention
2. **Validation** (Success/Strength) - Positive reinforcement of what's working
3. **Opportunity** (Growth/Optimization) - Actionable improvement potential

**Implementation**: `InsightEngine.ts` generates 5+ insights internally, then applies `selectOptimal3Insights()` for strategic selection
